# VSinatra
This proof-of-concept [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com) application uses [Vaadin Elements](http://vaadin.com/elements).

You can see [this application live on Heroku](http://sinatra-elements.herokuapp.com/). It is synchronised with `master` branch of this repository.

Steps needed to reproduce in order to include Vaadin Elements in your existing application can be found at the [Vaadin-Elements Gem](http://www.github.com/vaadin-miki/vaadin-elements) repository page.

This application serves as a demo and will be updated to highlight new features of the gem.
